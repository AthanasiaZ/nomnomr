# nomnomr.

An app for the nights when you wanna kill your friends. "nomnomr" offers tools that you and your friends can use, so that group food orders (a nightmare from the past) are fast and enjoyable. Agree on Food Categories, choose which Restaurant (or Restaurants) you will order from with swipes and Split the Bill, all in one app. Why isn't this a thing already you may ask... Well, we felt the same, so we made it. And now... "there is an app for that!"

## Execution Instructions (Under Construction)

### Installing Android Studio
• First of all, in order to download the latest Android Studio version (https://developer.android.com/studio) make sure your system completes the needed requirements. You can find them at the bottom of the previous link.  
The most important ones are: 8 GB RAM or more, 8 GB of available disk space minimum and 1280 x 800

• While installing Android studio steps are pretty easy. There are only two things you must pay attention at:

2. While choosing the type of setup, prefer "Standard", which is recommended for most users. 

• When the installation is done, download an emulator from "Device manager" (we are using Pixel 3 Api 29).  
• Clone the repository (https://github.com/iloudaros/nomnomr.git), then go to File -> Open and paste the link.    
• Click on "code" file and when you click "Ok" our project will open on a new window.
