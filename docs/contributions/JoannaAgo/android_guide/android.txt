Installation Guide
• First of all, in order to download the latest Android Studio make sure your system completes
the needed requirements. You can find them in the bottom of this link: developer.android.com/studio
The most important ones are: 8 GB RAM or more, 8 GB of available disk space minimum and 1280 x 800 
minimum screen resolution.
• While installing Android studio steps are pretty easy. The only thing you must pay attention at is
the point of choosing type of setup. Prefer "Standard", which is recommended for most users
• When the installation is done, download an emulator from "Device manager" ( we are working with
Pixel 3 Api 29)
• Clone the repository (https://github.com/iloudaros/nomnomr.git), then go to File -> Open and past 
the link  
• Click on "scr" file and when you click "Ok" our project will open on a new window
• Finally, click "Play" to test our app!
