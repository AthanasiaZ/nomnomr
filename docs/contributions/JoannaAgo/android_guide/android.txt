  Installation Guide
• First of all, in order to download the latest Android Studio version (https://developer.android.com/studio) 
make sure your system completes the needed requirements. You can find them at the bottom 
of the previous link.
The most important ones are: 8 GB RAM or more, 8 GB of available disk space minimum and 1280 x 800 
minimum screen resolution.
• While installing Android studio steps are pretty easy. There are only two things you must pay attention at:
1. Make sure "Android Virtual Device" box is checked,
2. While choosing the type of setup, prefer "Standard", which is recommended for most users.
• When the installation is done, download an emulator from "Device manager" ( we are working with
